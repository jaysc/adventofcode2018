# Day 16

I was hoping of iterating through a function list but I couldn't find a way. If I searched more I could have potentially find a way to do it.

For part 2, I just checked all instances where there was only one match, then tied the opcode to whatever function it matched on. Repeating this over and over again until all the opcode is match. There's probably a better way to do this though as I was basically doing it manually. Maybe running a loop and auto assigning it each time, the loop again until all are assigned.
