# Day 14

Took a while for me to understand what the question wanted, but in the end it was actually pretty simple.

Only hint I read was the usage of `modDiv`

Part 2 took a very long time, couldn't tell if I was doing something wrong or not, but instead it just required a lot of iterations until my particular code was found.
