# Day 12

This one was difficult.
I couldn't really understand how the plant evolved over time.

Looking at hints, I realised I should treat each index as the centre and lookup whether if it was going to be a plant or not.

For part 2, I heard that after a while it stabalised in difference, so I did lot of iterations, saw when it stopped changing, then did the maths.
