# Day 5

This one was easy, but only because it is similar to other code puzzles that involve the use of stack.

The optimisation for the second part could be better i guess, but i'm not sure what I could do instead.

Also, i'm assuming the if statement doesn't check all unless the preceding one is true, so to me doing the ascii difference value check first is a first pass check; something that isn't too difficult to do.
