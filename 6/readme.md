# Day 6

This one I'm ashamed I had to get some hints from the subreddit.
I didn't really know how to start properly until someone mentioned that if the closest point was on the endge of the bounding box, then that ponit would have infinite region.

I then found someone elses python script and compared what I was doing with theirs.

Logically speaking, it's not complicated, however it is slow.

The second part was easier, although I feel like i'm doing something wrong since it doesn't consider if those points are next to each other or not.
