# Day 3

This one was annoying due to how Python handles 2D arrays. How its prepared is complicated (for loop over a for loop)

I'm used to matlab ease with array manipulation, as well as its UI to display what the matrix looks like. Python doesn't have this feature and I can't see an VSCode extension for it.

This also was a very slow program to run, understandable as it was iterating over O(n^2)
