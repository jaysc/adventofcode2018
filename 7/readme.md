# Day 7

This one was very hard. I probably made it too complicated by creates nodes that knew what it ahead and behind was.

My original code involved working backwards starting from the bottom, however that ran into lots of problems, so the simplist approach was working from the top.

Definitely feel like there is a way requiring less information storage.
