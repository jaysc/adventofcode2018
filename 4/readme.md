# Day 4

Definitely the hardest so far, though that is expected.

When designing the code, I like to be organised. However, for problems that favour optimisation, this isn't the best route as there are much fast shortcuts that can be used.
That said, I really like to stay organised so I created classes to represent the one line of timestamp, then the class type for a guard.

You can see in my first attempt I was attempting to measure what each day entails, however I had a realisation that this was going to get very complicated, so I followed the optimised route using the assumptions:

`A guard falling asleep will always have the guard waking up`

It's a solid assumption, and if it was paired then who knows when the guard would wake up.

I like the fact that it is possible for the next guard duty to occur before the next day which would have complicated my route of determining what happens on each day.
